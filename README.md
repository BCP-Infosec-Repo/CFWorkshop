# CFWorkshop
"Understanding and Analyzing Carrier Files" workshop repo

# DefCon27 Workshop
This repo contains the slides and files required for my DefCon 27 (2019) "Understanding and Analyzing Carrier Files" Workshop. Get it gurl!

# Where's the GOOD stuff?
In the days leading up to the workshop, this repo will be updated with step-by-step instructions for the workshop. Until that time, the slides will serve as a reference point for the general makeup of the workshop.

# What?
YEAH! Let's do this!
